# Iris flower classification ðŸŒ¸

This project constitutes a pivotal component of my **Bharat Intern Virtual Internship**. It offers a thorough implementation of various machine learning algorithms for Iris classification, leveraging Python and the scikit-learn library. Through rigorous training on the well-established Iris dataset, the project aims to determine the species of iris flowers from the popular Iris Dataset. The diverse set of algorithms employed underscores the commitment to assessing the efficacy of various machine learning methodologies, contributing valuable insights within the context of the Iris dataset.
